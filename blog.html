            <p>Doing an action on each element of an existing array, the map() function creates a new array. The size of
                the output array will match that of the initial array. Without changing the original array, it gives
                back a new array. <br>
                By removing entries from an existing array that don't match a given criteria, the filter() function may
                be used to generate a new array. The length of the final array could differ from the initial array's
                length. It doesn't change the initial array; instead, it returns a new array. <br>
                When iterating across an array, the forEach() function is used to execute an operation on each element.
                Instead of returning a new array, it makes changes to the initial array. <br>
                Find the first member in an array that satisfies a specific requirement by using the find() function.
                When finding no elements, it returns undefined or the first matched element.

            What is the difference between local storage, session storage, cookies?

            <p>Persistence: Data stored in local storage and cookies can persist even after the user closes their
                browser or turns off their computer since they are persistent storage solutions. Data stored in session
                storage is only accessible during the user's browser session and is immediately deleted when the session
                has ended because it is a temporary storage solution. <br>

                Scope: A page from the same origin can only access data saved in Local Storage and Session Storage since
                they are scoped to the origin. But, cookies are scoped to a certain domain or subdomain and are
                accessible from any website on that domain. <br>

                Size: Cookies don't have as much storage space as Local Storage and Session Storage. Depending on the
                browser, Local Storage can save up to 5–10 MB of data, while Session Storage can hold the same amount of
                data (5–10 MB). On the other hand, cookies only have a 4 KB maximum storage size. <br>

                Transfer: When a request is made, Cookies are sent to the server, but Local Storage and Session Storage
                are not. As a result, information stored in cookies may be utilized to retain state across requests, but
                information stored in local storage and session storage is only accessible on the client side.

            What is event loop and how does it work?

        <div
            class="collapse-content bg-primary text-primary-content group-focus:bg-secondary group-focus:text-secondary-content">
            <p>Here is how the event loop operates: <br>
                1. To begin, the JavaScript engine runs the script on the main thread before moving it up the call
                stack. <br>

                2. The code will be removed from the call stack and added to the task queue if it runs into an
                asynchronous activity, such as a timer or a network request.<br>

                3. The task queue and call stack are continually monitored by the event loop. The event loop will pull
                the first job from the task queue and place it onto the call stack once the call stack is empty.<br>

                4. Any more asynchronous operations are subsequently added to the task queue once the job's code has
                been performed.<br>

                5. Since this procedure keeps repeating, JavaScript can handle asynchronous activities while remaining
                single-threaded.<br></p>

            Explain quizTimer() and chooseQuiz()?

                There is only one parameter for the function quizTimer, and that is dismiss. The purpose of this
                function is to create a quiz countdown timer. The interval timer is reset and the countdown is over if
                the function returns true. If not, it starts an interval timer and refreshes the timer display every
                second. The interval timer function's code initially selects an HTML element with the id "count" before
                figuring out how many minutes and seconds are left based on a variable called count. The minutes and
                seconds are formatted with leading zeros as necessary before being shown within the designated HTML
                element. If the count variable is more than 60, the code adds and removes CSS classes every two seconds
                to change the color of the text displayed inside the HTML element. <br>

                Index and GivenAns are the two arguments needed for the chooseQuiz function. The purpose of the function
                is to save the user's response to a quiz question and modify the list of possible answers in line with
                it. The code initially checks to see if the answer to the current quiz question has already been
                recorded in the answers array using the Array.find method. If the answer already exists, it replaces the
                old answer with the new one by traversing the answers array using a for...of loop and locating the
                appropriate answer object using its id attribute. The function creates a new answer object by splitting
                the quizData[index] object and adding the givenAns property if the answer does not already exist in the
                answers array.The function uses the answers array as an input and calls displayAnswers after updating
                the answers array. The objective of displayAnswers is to update the user interface to display the most
                recent list of answers. In conclusion, using this code enables users to select and store answers to quiz
                questions in an array. The function refreshes the previously saved response if the user modifies their
                response.
